- Have adequate knowledge of the various management, operational, and technical controls required and available to protect the IT resources for which they are responsible. <br>

All policies, procedures, and plans must be stored in a centrally accessible location available to all necessary stakeholders identified in Appendix R and Appendix S of the CWFY SSP.

### 4.0 Awareness and Training Controls

#### 4.1 AT-2 Literacy Training and Awareness

The ISSM is responsible for ensuring that all CWFY users, including managers, senior executives, and contractors, complete Security and Privacy Literacy training.  In some cases, the ISSM may accept documentation to prove that appropriate and comparable training has been completed elsewhere.

As part of onboarding for new hires, ACME Corporation For Widgets employees are required to complete Security and Privacy Literacy training. In addition, all new CWFY users are required to complete this training if not completed as part of their initial onboarding.

The training is delivered via Udemy which covers topics including, but not limited to, suspected phishing, acceptable use, data classification standards, privacy topics, acceptable and unacceptable use.

After the initial training, CWFY information system users are required to complete refresher Security and Privacy Literacy Training at least annually thereafter. In addition, system changes and/or implementing significant changes within the CWFY information system may also trigger the need for users to complete additional Security and Privacy Literacy Training.

Users are notified by Email when training is required.

ACME Corporation For Widgets employs the following additional techniques to increase the security and privacy awareness of CWFY information system users:

* Employee handbook
* Phishing exercises
* Security Practices which include a list of security process and procedures that can be consulted on-demand
* Logon screen messages
* Webinars
* Flyers
* 

To ensure that Literacy Training and Awareness remains relevant, the ISSM will work with identified internal teams to review and update the content at least annually.

#### 4.2 AT-2(2) Insider Threat

The ISSM shall ensure CWFY system users complete awareness and literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

#### 4.3 AT-2(3) Social Engineering and Mining

The ISSM shall ensure CWFY system users complete awareness and literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of social engineering and mining.

#### 4.4 AT-3 Role-based Training

Role based training must be provided to users that have elevated permissions, to include: Cloud Engineers; systems engineers; software developers; systems security engineers; security technical analysts; system, network, and database administrators; personnel with contingency planning and incident response duties; personnel with access to personally identifiable information.

Role-Based Security Training must be incorporated in the following circumstances:

* Before authorizing access to the system, information, or performing assigned duties
* At least annually thereafter
* When required by system changes

All ACME Corporation For Widgets developers are required to take the Secure Coding Training on an annual basis. The training addresses Secure Coding Guidelines for OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) for addressing security vulnerabilities commonly identified in the ACME Corporation For Widgets codebase.

The ISSM is responsible for updating content of role-based training provided on an annual basis, wherever applicable, and for ensuring the roles identified above participate in appropriate role-based training programs.

The also ISSM ensures that any lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches are incorporated into role-based training.

#### 4.5 AT-4 Training Records

The ACME Corporation For Widgets ISSM documents and monitors completion of information security and privacy training activities for all CWFY system users within Udemy and HR for at least five years after completion.
