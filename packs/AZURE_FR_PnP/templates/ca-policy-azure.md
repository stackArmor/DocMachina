#### 4.4 CA-2(3) Leveraging Results from External Organizations 
Leverage the results of control assessments performed by any FedRAMP Accredited 3PAO on {{customerSystemAcronym}} when the assessment meets the conditions of the JAB/AO in the FedRAMP Repository. 

#### 4.5 CA-3 Information Exchange
The exchange of information between the {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system and other systems shall be approved and managed using interconnection security agreements, information exchange security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service level agreements, user agreements, nondisclosure agreements or contracts in place between the provider of the external connection/service and
The exchange agreements shall include: 
- the interface characteristics,

The established interconnection agreements shall be reviewed and updated at least annually or on input from FedRAMP PMO. 

#### 4.6 CA-3(6) Transfer Authorizations (H)
It shall be verified that Individuals or systems transferring data between interconnecting systems have the requisite authorizations (i.e., write permissions or privileges) prior to accepting such data. 

#### 4.7 CA-5 Plan of Actions and Milestones
A POA&M shall be developed to document {{ustomerName}}’s remedial actions to correct deficiencies noted from assessment of the controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in {{customerSystemAcronym}} the system.

The POA&M shall be reviewed and updated at least monthly based on findings from control assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring activities. Updates to the POA&M shall also be done when remediation is complete, and the testing of the implemented security or privacy control meets the acceptable criteria to support a control being in place and operating as intended.

#### 4.8 CA-6 Security Authorization
A senior official shall be assigned as the authorizing official for the system and for common controls available for inheritance by organizational systems. 

Prior to commencing operations, the Authorizing Official shall accept the use of common controls inherited by the system and authorize the system to operate. 

The Authorizing Official for common controls shall authorize the use of those controls for inheritance by organizational systems. 
The authorization for {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system shall be updated in accordance with OMB A-130 requirements or when a significant change occurs. 

#### 4.9 CA-7 Continuous Monitoring
A continuous monitoring strategy for the {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system to be used throughout the systems accreditation Lifecyle as per FedRAMP requirements shall be developed and implemented. The strategy shall include the establishment of system-level metrics to be monitored that are in accordance with the metrics defined in the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide. 
Frequencies as defined in the {{customerSystemAcronym}} Continuous Monitoring Plan for monitoring and frequencies defined for the CA-2 control for assessment of control effectiveness shall be established. 

The continuous monitoring strategy shall account for ongoing control assessments and ongoing monitoring of system and metrics that are in accordance with the overall continuous monitoring strategy. 

The continuous monitoring strategy shall correlate and analyze information generated by control assessments and monitoring and define response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring information. 

The status of the {{customerSystemAcronym}} system shall be reported at least monthly to the FedRAMP JAB/PMO and AO. 

#### 4.10 CA-7(1) Independent Assessment
Independent assessors or assessment teams shall be employed to monitor the controls in the {{customerSystemAcronym}} system on an ongoing basis. 

#### 4.11 CA-7(4) Risk Monitoring
It shall be ensured that risk monitoring is an integral part of the continuous monitoring strategy that includes the following:
- Effectiveness monitoring;
- Compliance monitoring; and
- Change monitoring. 

#### 4.12 CA-8 Penetration Testing
Penetration testing shall be conducted at least annually on all information system components where penetration testing is feasible. 

#### 4.13 CA-8(1) Independent Penetration Testing Agent or Team
An independent 3PAO Penetration Testing Team shall be engaged to perform penetration testing at least annually on all information system components where penetration testing is feasible.  

#### 4.14 CA-8(2) Red Team Exercises
Employ the following red-team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational systems in accordance with applicable rules of engagement: red team exercises that meet the requirements of the FedRAMP Penetration Testing Guidance. 

#### 4.15 CA-9 Internal System Connections
All Internal System Connections which are to interface with the {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system environment shall be authorized. 

For each internal connection the interface characteristics, security and privacy requirements, and the nature of the information communicated shall be documented. 

Internal system connections shall be terminated after it has been determined that the internal system connection is no longer needed for the {{customerSystemAcronym}} system to execute the functions for which it was designed. 

All internal connections shall be reviewed at least annually.
