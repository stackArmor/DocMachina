#### 4.1 AT-2 Literacy Training and Awareness
The {{trainingVerifyRole}} is responsible for ensuring that all {{customerSystemAcronym}} users, including managers, senior executives, and contractors, complete Security and Privacy Literacy training.

After the initial training, {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system users are required to complete refresher Security and Privacy Literacy Training at least annually thereafter. In addition, system changes and/or implementing significant changes within the {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system may also trigger the need for users to complete additional Security and Privacy Literacy Training.

{{customerName}} employs the following additional techniques to increase the security and privacy awareness of {{customerSystemAcronym}} information system users: 

-	Employee handbook

-	Security Practices which include a list of security process and procedures that can be consulted on-demand
-	Logon screen messages 
-	{{trainingAdditional1}}
